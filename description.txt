In this repository we scrape list of ycombinator funded companies as well as their information (e.g location, team size, description, etc.), and then save them in a csv file.

We do the scraping in two steps; 1)at the first step we search for available webpages of companies on the ycombinator website and save urls of valid webpages to scrape information from each of them later on. 2) at the second step, for each valid url we send a HTTP request to crawl the html file and then parse the html file to extract interesting information of the related company( e.g. name, location, foundation year, etc.)
